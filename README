DBIx-FlexibleBinding

A DBI subclass that implements the following features:

    Support for multiple parameter placeholder schemes
        * Standard positional placeholders (?)
        * Numeric placeholders (:1 and ?1)
        * Named placeholders (:NAME and @NAME)
    
    Flexible argument list binding mechanisms
        * (list of values) and [list of values] for positional.
          placeholders.
        * (list of values) and [list of values] for numeric placeholders.
        * (list of key-value pairs), [list of key-value pairs] and 
          {list of key-value pairs} for named placeholders.
        
    Automatic binding dependant on disposition of placeholders
    
    Additional statement methods supporting fetching and processing 
    using callbacks
        * $sth->processrow_arrayref(CALLBACKS)
        * $sth->processrow_hashref(CALLBACKS)
        * $sth->processall_arrayref(CALLBACKS)
        * $sth->processall_hashref(CALLBACKS)
        
    Additional database methods supporting preparation, execution, fetching 
    and processing using callbacks
        * $dbh->processrow_arrayref(STATEMENT, ATTRS, BINDINGS, CALLBACKS)
        * $dbh->processrow_hashref(STATEMENT, ATTRS, BINDINGS, CALLBACKS)
        * $dbh->processall_arrayref(STATEMENT, ATTRS, BINDINGS, CALLBACKS)
        * $dbh->processall_hashref(STATEMENT, ATTRS, BINDINGS, CALLBACKS)
